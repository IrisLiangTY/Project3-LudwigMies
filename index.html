            <h1>About </h1>
            <p>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-born American architect. He was commonly addressed as Mies. He is regarded as a pioneer of the modern architecture. His rectilinear forms, crafted in elegant simplicity, epitomized the international style of architecture. His designs exemplify his famous principle ‘less is more’ and demonstrate forthright use of the most modern materials, such as industrial steel and plate glass, his exceptional sense of proportion and his extreme concern for detail. He called his buildings ‘skin and bones’ architecture. He sought an objective approach that would guide the creative process of architectural design. He created a modern twentieth-century architectural style, adorned with clarity and simplicity. The spirit of modern era can be seen in his projects.

            <h1>Portfolio </h1>
            <p>Mies van der Rohe's main design ideas are structure first, then form, space first, then function, and organization, which can be summarized by his "less is more" in 1928.
                It can be reflected in two aspects
             <p> 1. Simplification of structural systems and streamlining of structural elements to produce spaces that can be used for any purpose without barriers or with few barriers.</p>  
             <p> 2. Purification of the building form, precise construction, so that the building has nothing superfluous attached to it, just a steel box made of glass and steel.</p>

            <h1>Concept </h1>
            <p>"Devils are in the details" When Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, one of the world's greatest architects of the 20th century, was asked to describe the reason for his success in one sentence, he said only five words: "Devils are in the details"; this shows his rigor and his philosophy.</p>
            <p>"Less is more" What Mies calls "less" is not blank but streamlined, and "more" is not congestion but perfection. Mies' art of architecture depends on structure, but is not limited by it. 
            <p> "Circulation space" This circulation space is rational, orderly, interior space, and, importantly, it is static and its purpose is practical.</p>  
            <p> "Universal space" In the circulation space, the large space is divided into several small interconnected spaces, and when we remove the partition walls, we are left with a large space. In this space, we can arrange and transform it into any form we want. This is the "total space". </p>

            <h1>Archives </h1>
            <p>The Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Archive, an administratively independent section of the Museum of Modern Art's department of architecture and design, was established in 1968 by the museum's trustees. It was founded in response to the architect's desire to bequeath his entire work to the museum. The archive consists of about nineteen thousand drawings and prints.

</p>
<p>Archival materials are also held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Collection, 1929–1969 (bulk 1948–1960) includes correspondence, articles, and materials related to his association with the Illinois Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>Other archives are held at the University of Illinois at Chicago (personal book collection), the Canadian Centre for Architecture (drawings and photos) in Montreal, the Newberry Library in Chicago (personal correspondence), and at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. (professional correspondence).</p>
